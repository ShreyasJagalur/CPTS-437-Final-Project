# Running the Code

The most optimal way to run our code is to use our Google Colab Notebook:

Additioanly you will have to locally download and upload the datasets to use them in our notebook as explained below:

- Download dataset from our github data folder
- Locally upload dataset to the Google Colab Notebook
- Confirm that the directories to the dataset in the Data Loading section of the code match the directory of the uploaded datasets
