Additioanly you will have to localy downlaod and upload the datsets to use them in our notebook as explained below:

- Download dataset from our github data folder
- Locally upload dataset to the Google Colab Notebook
- Confirm that the directories to the dataset in the Data Loading section of the code match the directory of the uploaded datasets
